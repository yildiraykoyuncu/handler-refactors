# Handler Refactors

Welcome.

This repository contains a whole bunch of mini-websites for you to study and practice developing.  Each one implements a single user story, and each one is organized the same way. The goal of these exercises isn't to create mind-blowing projects.

Instead the goal to get lots of practice navigating source code, debugging, and incrementally developing websites that handle user input with JavaScript.

There are 5 sets of exercises:

* [Duck Duck Search](./duck-duck-search)
* [HoverCraft](./hovercraft)
* [Hex Setter](./hex-setter)
* [Sub-String](./sub-string)
* [Type Caster](./type-caster)

And 3 examples to study:

* [Color Palate](./z-example-color-palate)
* [Flip Book](./z-example-flip-book)
* [Mouse Coordinates](./z-example-mouse-coordinates)
